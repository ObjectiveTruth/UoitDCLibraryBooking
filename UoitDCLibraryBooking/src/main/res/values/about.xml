        <p>Hey, thanks for checking out this page.\n\nI\'m a UOIT Comp Sci student and this is my first android app.
        Sorry if there are any bugs but I hope you find it useful since the old booking system is so archaic.\n\n Check
        out my blog at <a href="www.ObjectiveTruth.ca">www.ObjectiveTruth.ca</a> and read up on the adventures of getting this thing off the ground.
        If you have any comments or suggestions feel free to comment there.\n\n

        Last thing, sorry about the ads, but it took about 4 months to get all this working, and I figure if you found it useful,
        you wouldn\'t mind seeing a few ads here and there. Hope i\'m not wrong. \n\nIf you do hate it enough you can disable them all with the button above.\n\n
        Cheers!
    </p>
